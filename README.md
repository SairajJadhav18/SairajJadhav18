## Hi there 👋

I’m *Sairaj Jadhav*, a **Computer Science student at Dalhousie University** with hands-on experience designing, building, and deploying real-world software systems. I enjoy working across the full stack from crafting intuitive user interfaces to developing secure backend services and deploying applications on cloud infrastructure.

I have professional experience as a **Junior Web Developer** in a healthcare environment, where I worked closely with clinicians, internal teams, and other stakeholders to support a production-level clinical web application. My work involved developing and integrating RESTful APIs, optimizing database queries, improving dashboard performance, and supporting application security and stability, while incorporating user and stakeholder feedback. This experience strengthened my interest in building **reliable, secure, and scalable systems**.

Beyond coursework and work experience, I focus on **project-driven learning**. I’ve built cloud-hosted analytics platforms, machine learning pipelines, and full-stack web applications that emphasize clean architecture, data integrity, performance, and security-aware design. I’m particularly interested in how **cybersecurity principles** intersect with backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and real-world applications.
